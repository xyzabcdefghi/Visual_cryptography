# # Visual Cryptography GUI

## Introduction
Visual Cryptography GUI is a Python-based project that implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for Visual Cryptography. Visual Cryptography is a cryptographic technique used for secure data distribution, where a confidential image is divided into multiple shares, and the original image can be reconstructed when a specific number of shares are overlaid.

This project aims to provide users with a user-friendly interface to interact with Visual Cryptography, enabling them to input images for encryption and displaying the encrypted results.

## Features
- Input images for encryption
- Display encrypted results
- Supports both color and black-and-white images
- User-friendly interface is built
